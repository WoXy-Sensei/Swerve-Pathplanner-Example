Welcome to the Swerve Path Planner Example repository! This project provides an illustrative example of a swerve drive path planner implemented in JAVA, designed to assist developers in understanding swerve drive systems and path planning algorithms.

# NOTE IMPORTANT:
If you are using the full neo engine, I recommend you to use Phoenix V6, otherwise there may be problems, you can contact me for any support.
